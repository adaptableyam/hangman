This is a simple Python program based on the game Hangman.
Please make sure to keep the wordlist.txt file in the same directory as the hangman.py file for the program to run correctly.

It implements all the features you would expect from the Hangman game, including:
- A randomly selected word, pulled from the wordlist.txt file. 
- A way to start a new game
- Tracking of Letters already used
- A visual representation of how many guesses you have left
- A blank work that updates as you guess correct letters
- Winning and losing conditions based upon if you guessed the word in the number of tries or not

How to play:
- Run the main hangman.py file
- When prompted if you want to play, select Yes.
- Type a single-character and submit it using the 'Enter' key.
- Continue this until the game is over.
